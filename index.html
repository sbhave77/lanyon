    Hello world! My name is <b>Shreyas Bhave</b>. I'm currently a PhD student at the Columbia Department of Biomedical Informatics studying Machine Learning in the context of healthcare. I am passionate about applying computer science, machine learning, and statistics to health related problems. My recent work focuses on how we can detect and handle missingness in tabular data. Furthermore, I am working on approaches to better model multi-scale irregularly sampled time sereies data. This is a blog of sorts where I share my insights on my interests, including biomedical informatics, politics and machine learning!
